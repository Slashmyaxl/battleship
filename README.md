# Battleship

Using Webpack as a bundler and Jest for testing, I will develop a browser-based game of Battleship in which a human player will be able to play against the computer. While the primary focus will be on practicing test-driven development, this is a well-rounded project with several layers. A graphical user interface will be included for the user to interact with the game, thus HTML for structure and CSS for styling will be utilized. Not only do I hope to continue on my module and OOP-based principles, but I plan on using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM with each interaction as well.
